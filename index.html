        <p>Oregon has the most convenient voting system in the country. Since adopting vote-by-mail, Oregon consistently ranks as a national leader in voter turnout.</p>
        <p>Registered voters receive a ballot two to three weeks before an election, giving time to research issues or candidates.</p>
        <p>Voters also receive an official ballot to complete and insert into the security envelope which is placed in the ballot return envelope and signed by the voter. The ballot return envelope can be stamped and mailed or dropped off at any official drop box​ across the state. If a voter casts their ballot after the Wednesday before an election, the ballot should be left at a drop box site to ensure it's counted.</p> 
        <p>Ballots must be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day.​​​​​​</p>

        <p>But good news! You're just <span class="difference"></span> years away from participating in our great democratic experiment. Until then, here are a few things you can do to stay active and engaged with the government:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Stay alive.</strong><br />The dead can't vote, so keep on livin' if you want to vote.</li>
            <li><strong>Dont' despair.</strong><br />It's easy to get discouraged by how shitty the world can seem, but tyranny feeds on apathy, so don't give up hope just quite yet.</li>
            <li><strong>Don't read the comments.</strong></br>This doesn't have much to do with politics, it's just a good rule to live by.</li>
          </ul>
